## Overview of the analysis

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Overall goal is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Both Omar and V. Isualize want to see visualizations that really illuminate the data previously described. 

## Results

After reviewing the details for the fare and ride per city type, the following details were noted:
- Rural  total rides was 125, total drivers was 78, and total fare was $34.62
- Suburban total rides was 625 and total drivers was 490, and total fare was $30.97
- Urban total rides was 1,625 and total drivers was 2,405, and total fare was $24.53

In regards to the avergae fare per driver and per ride:
- Rural average fare per ride was $34.62 and per driver was $55.49
- Suburaban average fare per ride was $30.97 and per driver was $39.50
- Urban average fare per ride was $24.53 and per driver was $16.57

In the image below, it shows that urban fare from January through April had the most average fare and activities (while rural had the least):

*This graph makes sense, as rural areas are more spread out than urban areas, whith more traffic and businesses nearby within urban areas.*

## Summary

Overall, the following recommendations can be review by the BOD and CEO:
1. Provide more services within the urban areas. That way, revenue can increase because there is more fare to collect.
2. Put more availiablity within the rural areas. Although this could lead to a large expense (because few people are in these areas), this could potentially be a better outcome for the company. With customers noticing that the business is expanding, the customers will start to see it as respectful.
3. Increase the drivers in Lak Jonathanshire. There appear to only be 5 drivers within that city, expand to reach a wider audience.
