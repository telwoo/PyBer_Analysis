V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Overall goal is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Both Omar and V. Isualize want to see visualizations that really illuminate the data previously described. 


## Results
